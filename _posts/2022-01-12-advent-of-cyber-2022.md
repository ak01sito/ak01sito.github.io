After waiting for a full year, it's finally back! [Try Hack Me](https://tryhackme.com) is hosting their famous [Advent of Cyber](https://tryhackme.com/room/adventofcyber4) for the 4th time. It consists of a series of beginner challenges, which you can complete every day from the first of December until Christmas. I thought it would be cool to give it a go, so I'll try to update everyday (or as soon as I can) for the different challenges I complete.

They have a cool story following the whole duration of the challenges, which explains that we need to solve the challenges in order to save Christmas. I will not follow the story so much, so hope you just enjoy the challenges.

# Day 1 - Someone's coming to town! (Frameworks)

TOday we will be simply relating words with their definition. When we press on the *View Site* green button, we can see a website in which we have to solve 3 puzzles. Those are not too difficult, but they teach us about the different phases of the **Unified Kill Chain**. For each puzzle we have some deffinitions, and we need to see which piece goes where depending on that. The puzzles' clues and solutions look as follow: 

**Puzzle 1**

1. Research is part of my task, finding clues in public sources. **Reconnaissance**
2. Simple documents I turn into malware. **Weaponisation**
3. A pizza, parcel or payload all have me as an action in common. **Delivery**
4. A con is the name of my game, tricking you into believing a false identity. **Social Engineering**
5. Weaknesses are my go-to resources; through them, I make my presence felt. **Exploitation**
6. I am set up to let you back into the network after you leave. **Persistence**
7. Deletion of evidence is part of my process. **Defence Evasion**
8. Communication with the compromised goes through me. **Command & Control**

![puzzle 1](/images/adventofcyber_puzzle1.png)

**Puzzle 2**

1. I am an anchor that lets you go on an adventure and explore. **Pivoting**
2. With me, you can locate new information to expand the attack. **Discovery**
3. Once a pawn, I became a King. **Privilege Escalation**
4. My payloads are triggered to infect all they come in contact with. **Execution**
5. Passwords I collect are the keys to the mainframe. **Credential Access**
6. Side to side, machine to machine, we hop. **Lateral Movement**

![puzzle 2](/images/adventofcyber_puzzle2.png)

**Puzzle 3**

1. In your vault, I am in. **Access**
2. Like a dragon, I gather all valuable loot. **Collection**
3. I export gathered treasures. **Exfiltration**
4. With me, your reputation goes tumbling down. **Impact**
5. Goals set, goals attained. I win! **Objectives**

![puzzle 3](/images/adventofcyber_puzzle3.png)

After completing the 3 puzzles, we see a final page in which we get the info to answer the two questions of the challenge: 

**Who is the adversary that attacked Santa's network this year?**
`The Bandit Yeti`

**What's the flag that they left behind?**
`THM{IT'S A Y3T1 CHR1$TMA$}`

# Day 2 - Santa's Naughty and Nice Log (Log Analysis)

For today's challenge we are going to be taking a look at log files. For that, we start the machine and connect to it via `ssh`:

`ssh elfmcblue@IP_ADDRESS`

Introduce the password when prompted, and we can start answering the questions: 

**Use the ls command to list the files present in the current directory. How many log files are present?**

~~~
elfmcblue@day-2-log-analysis:~$ ls
SSHD.log  webserver.log
~~~

So the answer is `2` (`SSHD.log` and `webserver.log`).

**Elf McSkidy managed to capture the logs generated by the web server. What is the name of this log file?** Looks like it's the one called `webserver.log` (what a surprise).

**On what day was Santa's naughty and nice list stolen?**
We don't know how the list is called exactly, but let's assume it has either the word "naughty" or "nice".

~~~
elfmcblue@day-2-log-analysis:~$ grep naughty webserver.log 
10.10.249.191 - - [18/Nov/2022:12:35:18 +0000] "GET /naughty-james HTTP/1.1" 404 437 "-" "gobuster/3.0.1"
~~~

BINGO!

So the date is 18th of November of 2022. I tried a few ways of writing this down on the platform and nothing was working. Finally I looked for which day of the week 18th of November of 2022 was, and then the platform accepted it!

So the answer is `friday`.

**What is the IP address of the attacker?**
In the same line of the log retrieved for the previous question, we can see that the IP address used was `10.10.249.191`, so that's the answer.

**What is the name of the important list that the attacker stole from Santa?**
Since we know that the list has the structure `**********.***` (so, 10 characters, a dot, and 3 more characters), we can try to use the `grep -E` flag to use regex. The expression used is `[A-Za-z0-9]{10}\.[A-Za-z0-9]{3}`

~~~
elfmcblue@day-2-log-analysis:~$ grep -E "[A-Za-z0-9]{10}\.[A-Za-z0-9]{3}" webserver.log 
10.9.12.30 - - [18/Nov/2022:12:18:23 +0000] "GET /assets/css/stylesheet.e534de95c45f12e712642d4891fdc622837d0270dd58b129282e0e4b65b5df1a.css HTTP/1.1" 200 4526 "http://10.10.60.160/" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/107.0.0.0 Safari/537.36"
10.10.249.191 - - [18/Nov/2022:12:34:39 +0000] "GET /santaslist.txt HTTP/1.1" 200 133872 "-" "Wget/1.19.4 (linux-gnu)"
~~~

Not sure if my regex is nice and elegant, since I'm not good at it, but it worked, so we find that the list is `santaslist.txt`

**Look through the log files for the flag. The format of the flag is: THM{}**
Since we know part of the structure of the flag, it will be easy to get it with another grep. 
First we try the `webserver.log` file:

~~~
elfmcblue@day-2-log-analysis:~$ grep THM webserver.log 
10.10.249.191 - - [18/Nov/2022:12:35:20 +0000] "GET /AU7VTHM1YVYV8 HTTP/1.1" 404 437 "-" "gobuster/3.0.1"
~~~

mmmm so there is a line which contains "THM", but that's not the flag. Let's try it on the other log file (`SSHD.log`)
~~~
elfmcblue@day-2-log-analysis:~$ grep "THM" SSHD.log
THM{STOLENSANTASLIST}
~~~

There it is! Second day solved

# Day 3 - Nothing escapes detective McRed  (OSINT)

Today's challenge is focused on OSINT, which is the data and information that is collected from publicly available sources. As always, we get a bit of information on the topic, which is really nicely explained and contains everything we need to solve the questions. So let's get to it:

**What is the name of the Registrar for the domain santagift.shop?**
Let's look for the domain's information in the [who.is](https://who.is/whois) website. We enter the domain `santagift.shop`, and the first thing on the information table we see is the *Registrar Info*, where we can see that the name is `NAMECHEAP INC`.

**Find the website's source code (repository) on github.com and open the file containing sensitive credentials. Can you find the flag?**
If we go to [GitHub](https://github.com), and search for `Santagiftshop` or `santagift.shop`, we will see the repository from muhammadthm: 

![github repo](/images/adventofcyber_day3_1.png)


Looking around a bit, we see that the flag is at the beginning  of the file `config.php`. So the answer is `THM_OSINT_WORKS`.

**What is the name of the file containing passwords?**
As said in the previous question, the file is `config.php`.

**What is the name of the QA server associated with the website?**
On the main page of the repository on GitHub, we can see that the `README` is already giving us the answer: 

![github QA domain](/images/adventofcyber_day3_2.png)

So the answer is `qa.santagift.shop`.

**What is the DB_PASSWORD that is being reused between the QA and PROD environments?**
On the same `config.php` file we saw before, if we look for `DB_PASSWORD`, we see that the two occurrences have the same value (`S@nta2022`), and they are used `if($ENV = "QA")`, and `if($ENV = "PROD")`. Which means that the QA and PROD environments share the same value of `DB_PASSWORD`. The answer is then `S@nta2022`.

See you tomorrow!

# Day 4 - Scanning through the snow (Scanning)

Today we will be scanning a host for open ports, and use the information from yesterday's challenge in order to see how the `santagift.shop` website was compromised.  

First of all, let's see which ports are open and what are the services running on those.

~~~
└─$ nmap -sV <IP_ADDRESS>     
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-12-04 17:52 CET
Nmap scan report for <IP_ADDRESS>

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 13.12 seconds
~~~

With that, we can already answer the firsts questions:

**What is the name of the HTTP server running on the remote host?** : `Apache`.

**What is the name of the service running on port 22 on the QA server?** `ssh`.

For the last two questions we will need to connect to the Samba service. Since I haven't used it much, I thought I would do it through `cli` (opposite to the way they show on the platform), and learn a bit for future challenges. We are given: 

* Username : `ubuntu` 
* password : `S@nta2022`
* ip address : may vary. I'll show it as `<IP_ADDRESS>`

First, to see which shares are available on this host, let's run `smbclient -U ubuntu -L <IP_ADDRESS>`, and enter the password when prompted: 

~~~
└─$ smbclient -U ubuntu -L <IP_ADDRESS> 
Enter WORKGROUP\ubuntu's password: 

        Sharename       Type      Comment
        ---------       ----      -------
        print$          Disk      Printer Drivers
        sambashare      Disk      Samba on Ubuntu
        admins          Disk      Samba on Ubuntu
        IPC$            IPC       IPC Service (ip-<IP_ADDRESS> server (Samba, Ubuntu))
SMB1 disabled -- no workgroup available
~~~

The share `admins` looks juicy, so let's access this one. The service is called `//<IP_ADDRESS>/admins`: 

~~~
└─$ smbclient -U ubuntu //<IP_ADDRESS>/admins S@nta2022
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.
smb: \> ls
  .                                   D        0  Thu Nov 10 06:44:30 2022
  ..                                  D        0  Wed Nov  9 18:43:21 2022
  flag.txt                            A       23  Wed Nov  9 18:55:58 2022
  userlist.txt                        A      111  Thu Nov 10 06:44:29 2022
~~~

Looks like we got it! Now we will use `smbget` to download the files from the share. 

~~~

~~~

**What flag can you find after successfully accessing the Samba service?** As we can see in the output of the `cat flag.txt` command, the flag is `{THM_SANTA_SMB_SERVER}`.

**What is the password for the username santahr?** As we can see in the output of the `cat unserlist.txt` command, the password is `santa25`.

# Day 5 - He knows when you're awake (Brute-Forcing)

Welcome to Day 5 of Advent of Cyber.  Today we'll be discovering a password via brute-forcing, and using it to connect to the VNC server.  Let's see what they ask us to do:

**Use Hydra to find the VNC password of the target with IP address `<IP_ADDRESS>`. What is the password?**

We will the use the tool *Hydra* for that. The command we want to use has the following syntax: 

`hydra -l username -P wordlist.txt server service`
* username : they didn't give us a specific username, so let's try it without one.
* wordlist.txt : On kali linux there are already pre-made wordlists. We'll be using `/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`
* server : that's the IP address given when starting the machine. In my case it's `10.10.170.133`
* service : which service we want to launch the attack to (`ssh`, `rdp`, `ftp`, `vnc`, etc). In this case they are asking us for `vnc`

So we run `hydra -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.170.130 vnc`

![hydra](/images/adventofcyber_day5_hydra.png)

After a while, it finds a valid pair, which means that there was no user, and the password is `1q2w3e4r`. 

**Using a VNC client on the AttackBox, connect to the target of IP address MACHINE_IP. What is the flag written on the target’s screen?**

To solve this, I decided to use `vncviewer`. The syntax is `vncviewer host::port`. We are missing the port, so we can just run the following nmap command: 

```
└─$ nmap -sV 10.10.170.133  
Starting Nmap 7.92 ( [https://nmap.org](https://nmap.org/) ) at 2022-12-05 12:36 EST  
Nmap scan report for 10.10.170.133  
Host is up (0.034s latency).  
Not shown: 998 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)  
PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION  
22/tcp   open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.5 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)  
5900/tcp open  vnc     VNC (protocol 3.8)  
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel  
  
Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at [https://nmap.org/submit/](https://nmap.org/submit/) .  
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 1.57 seconds
```

We find then that the port is `5900`, and we can now connect to the target via vnc. 

```
└─$ vncviewer 10.10.170.133::5900  
Connected to RFB server, using protocol version 3.8  
Performing standard VNC authentication  
Password:  
Authentication successful  
```
And automatically, the remote target's window pops up:
![puzzle 3](/images/adventofcyber_day5_vnc.png)
We can see on the background of the screen that the flag is `THM{I_SEE_YOUR_SCREEN}`.

# Day 6 - It's beginning to look a lot like phishing (Email Analysis) 

On today's challenge we'll be analyzing the headers and files on emails to determine if they are malicious, where did they actually come from, and so on. 

After starting the machine, let's open the "Split View" on the platform. We see a Desktop with a file called `Urgent:.eml`. That's what we will be analyzing. 
We will run the following command to get all the information from the file: `emlAnalyzer  -i Urgent\:.eml  --header --html -u --text --extract-all`

![emlanalyzer](/images/adventofcyber_day6_emlanalyzer.png)

**What is the email address of the sender?** `chief.elf@santaclaus.thm`

**What is the return address?** `murphy.evident@bandityeti.thm`

**On whose behalf was the email sent?** `Chief Elf`

**What is the X-spam score?** `3`

**What is hidden in the value of the Message-ID field?** We see the string `QW9DMjAyMl9FbWFpbF9BbmFseXNpcw==`, which looks like a base64 encoded message, so we decode it like: 
```
ubuntu@ip-10-10-102-13:~/Desktop$ echo QW9DMjAyMl9FbWFpbF9BbmFseXNpcw== | base64 -d 
AoC2022_Email_Analysis
```

So the answer is `AoC2022_Email_Analysis`.

**Visit the email reputation check website provided in the task. What is the reputation result of the sender's email address?** So we go to [this](https://emailrep.io/) website, which they provided in the task, and we search for `chief.elf@santaclaus.thm`

![attachment](/images/adventofcyber_day6_risky.png)

So the answer is `risky`.

**Check the attachments. What is the filename of the attachment?** If we scroll down the output of the command, we see the "Attachment Extracting" part, where we see that the filename of the attachment is `Division_of_labour-Load_share_plan.doc`

![attachment](/images/adventofcyber_day6_attachment.png)

**What is the hash value of the attachment?** To calculate that, let's run the following commands: 

```
ubuntu@ip-10-10-102-13:~/Desktop$ cd eml_attachments/
ubuntu@ip-10-10-102-13:~/Desktop/eml_attachments$ sha256sum Division_of_labour-Load_share_plan.doc 

0827bb9a2e7c0628b82256759f0f888ca1abd6a2d903acdb8e44aca6a1a03467  Division_of_labour-Load_share_plan.doc
```

So the hash is `0827bb9a2e7c0628b82256759f0f888ca1abd6a2d903acdb8e44aca6a1a03467`

**Visit the Virus Total website and use the hash value to search. Navigate to the behaviour section. What is the second tactic marked in the Mitre ATT&CK section?** Let's go to the [Virus Total](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/search) search tab, and enter the hash. Once found, we can navigate to the "Behavior" tab, and then we scroll down to the "Mitre ATT&CK" section, and there we see that the second tactic is `Defense Evasion`.

**Visit the InQuest website and use the hash value to search.
What is the subcategory of the file?** Let's go to the [InQuest](https://labs.inquest.net/) website, and search for the hash on the "Indicator Lookup". Once it finds a match, let's click on that and see that Subcategory:
`macro_hunter`

# Day 7 - Maldocs roasting on an open fire (CyberChef)

Today we will be taking a look at [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/), and learning what we can use it for. Let's start by starting the machine, and going to Firefox, where there is an offline version of CyberChef on the bookmarks

**What is the version of CyberChef found in the attached VM?** Once we enter CyberChef, on the url we can see that the version is `9.49.0`.

**How many recipes were used to extract URLs from the malicious doc?** `10`. Those are the following ones: 
1. **Strings**
2. **Find/Replace** : To remove all `[`, `]`, and end of lines (`\n`).
3. **Drop bytes** : To remove the initial text and keep only the base64 encoded text.
4. **From Base64** : to decode the text.
5. **Decode text** : to decode it from `UTF-16LE(1200` encoding.
6. **Find/Replace** : to remove all `'`, `(`, `)`, `+`, `"`
7. **Find/Replace** : to replace `]b2H_` for `http`.
8. **Extract URLs**
9. **Split** : to indicate where each url finishes.
10. **Defang URL** : to make sure the URLs are not clickable.

**We found a URL that was downloading a suspicious file; what is the name of that malware?** `mysterygift.exe`.

**What is the last defanged URL of the bandityeti domain found in the last step?** `hxxps[://]cdn[.]bandityeti[.]THM/files/index/`

**What is the ticket found in one of the domains? (Format: Domain/GOLDEN_FLAG)** 
The domain is `https://www.secretSanta.THM/Goldenticket/THM_MYSTERY_FLAG`, so the ticket is `THM_MYSTERY_FLAG`.

# Day 8 - Last Christmas I gave you my ETH (Smart Contracts) (DRAFT)

Today we will be taking a look at smart contracts and how to exploit them. For that, we need to download the files tryhackme provides us with, and unzip it. We will then be using [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) to test and deploy contracts in a safe and controlled environment like if they were on a public blockchain.

<div style="padding: 15px; border: 1px solid transparent; border-color: transparent; margin-bottom: 20px; border-radius: 4px; color: #a94442; background-color: #f2dede; border-color: #ebccd1;">
Writeup for this challenge still incoming ....
</div>

**What flag is found after attacking the provided EtherStore Contract?** `flag{411_ur_37h_15_m1n3}`

# Day 14 - I'm dreaming of secure web apps (Web Application)

In today's challenge we will go over a really common Web Application vulnerability: IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference). IDOR is a type of application vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute commands based on user input, usually in a URL. Let's see how that works in a real example.

Once we start the machine and get the IP (`10.10.13.236` in my case), we can scan it for open ports:

```
└─$ nmap -sV 10.10.13.236
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-12-15 18:48 CET
Nmap scan report for 10.10.13.236
Host is up (0.059s latency).
Not shown: 998 closed ports
PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp   open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.5 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
8080/tcp open  http    Node.js Express framework
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
```

We can see that there is an `http` service on port `8080`. We can try to access that now on our browser to see how this website looks. For that, let's navigate to `http://10.10.13.236:8080`.

We can see a login page, quite expected since they gave us credentials already. So let's enter user =`mcskidy` and password=`devtest`. Once inside, we can see *Elf McSkidy* information:

![elf](/images/adventofcyber_elfmcskidy.png)

Now, let's answer some questions:

**What is the office number of Elf Pivot McRed?** So they are asking for some information on the page... belonging to another user. How can we do that if we don't have their credentials? Quite easy with IDOR ;)

Taking the url (`http://10.10.13.236:8080/users/101.html`), we can see that it's loading a `101.html` page. We can then ask ourselves, is there any `102.html` page? and `103.html`? Do I have access to them? Let's try it out. 

When we change the url and request `http://10.10.13.236:8080/users/102.html`, we suddenly  get access to *Elf Log McBlue*'s information! If we keep changing the file to find *Elf Pivot McRead*, we'll find him at file `105.html`, and his office number is `134`.

**Not only profile pages but also stored images are vulnerable. Start with a URL of a valid profile image; what is the hidden flag?** So they are already telling us that not only the url is vulnerable, but also the images. Let's find the place where they load the profile image in the  source code (we can see it when pressing `F12`). We will see the following code: 

![src code](/images/adventofcyber_codeIDOR.png)

So it's loading the profile image from `../images/101.png`. After trying again for a while, when I entered `../images/100.png`, we can see the profile picture substituted  by the flag `THM{CLOSE_THE_DOOR}`.
