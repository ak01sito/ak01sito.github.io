After waiting for a full year, it's finally back! [Try Hack Me](https://tryhackme.com) is hosting their famous [Advent of Cyber](https://tryhackme.com/room/adventofcyber4) for the 4th time. It consists of a series of beginner challenges, which you can complete every day from the first of December until Christmas. I thought it would be cool to give it a go, so I'll try to update everyday (or as soon as I can) for the different challenges I complete.

They have a cool story following the whole duration of the challenges, which explains that we need to solve the challenges in order to save Christmas. I will not follow the story so much, so hope you just enjoy the challenges.

# Day 1 - Someone's coming to town!

When we press on the *View Site* green button, we can see a website in which we have to solve 3 puzzles. Those are not too difficult, but they teach us about the different phases of the **Unified Kill Chain**. The puzzles look as follow: 

**Puzzle 1**

1. Research is part of my task, finding clues in public sources.
2. Simple documents I turn into malware.
3. A pizza, parcel or payload all have me as an action in common.
4. A con is the name of my game, tricking you into believing a false identity.
5. Weaknesses are my go-to resources; through them, I make my presence felt.
6. I am set up to let you back into the network after you leave.
7. Deletion of evidence is part of my process.
8. Communication with the compromised goes through me.

**Puzzle 2**

1. I am an anchor that lets you go on an adventure and explore.
2. With me, you can locate new information to expand the attack.
3. Once a pawn, I became a King.
4. My payloads are triggered to infect all they come in contact with.
5. Passwords I collect are the keys to the mainframe.
6. Side to side, machine to machine, we hop.

After completing the 3 puzzles, we see a final page in which we get the info to answer the two questions of the challenge: 

**Who is the adversary that attacked Santa's network this year?**
`The Bandit Yeti`

**What's the flag that they left behind?**
`THM{IT'S A Y3T1 CHR1$TMA$}`
