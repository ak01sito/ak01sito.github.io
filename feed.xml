This time it’s a crypto one, called Android-in-the-Middle. To know what we have to do and how to get the flag, let’s look at the code they give us in source.py : from Crypto.Cipher import AES from Crypto.Util.number import long_to_bytes import hashlib import random import socketserver import signal FLAG = "HTB{--REDACTED--}"... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Hack The Box - Juggling Facts</title><link href="https://ak01sito.github.io/posts/juggling-facts/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hack The Box - Juggling Facts" /><published>2023-02-06T06:28:00+01:00</published> <updated>2023-02-10T22:37:41+01:00</updated> <id>https://ak01sito.github.io/posts/juggling-facts/</id> <content src="https://ak01sito.github.io/posts/juggling-facts/" /> <author> <name>Mireia</name> </author> <category term="ctf" /> <category term="hack the box" /> <summary> Today I was feeling inspired and decided to give a try to a HackTheBox challenge.
